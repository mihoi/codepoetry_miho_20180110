The Second Coming, by Yeats

==========

Turning and turning in the widening gyre

The falcon cannot hear the falconer;

Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere

The ceremony of innocence is drowned;

I forgot line seven of the poem.

I also don't know line eight.

I forgot line nine, plus I forgot that while online.

Line 10
